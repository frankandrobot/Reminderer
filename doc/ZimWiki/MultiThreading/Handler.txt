====== Handler ======
Created Thursday 11 July 2013

The Handler class can be used to register to a thread and provides a simple channel to send data to this thread.

A Handler object registers itself with the thread in which it is created. For example, if you create a new instance of the Handler class in the onCreate() method of your activity, the resulting Handler object can be used to post data to the main thread.
