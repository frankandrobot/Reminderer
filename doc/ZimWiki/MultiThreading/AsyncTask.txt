====== AsyncTask ======
Created Thursday 11 July 2013

The AsyncTask class encapsulates the creation of a background process and the synchronization with the main thread. It also supports reporting progress of the running tasks.

Android executes AsyncTask tasks before Android 1.6 and again as of Android 3.0 in sequence by default.

You can tell Android to run it in parallel with the usage of the executeOnExecutor() method, specifying AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR as first parameter.

The AsyncTask does not handle configuration changes automatically, i.e. if the activity is recreated, the programmer has to handle that in his coding.

A common solution to this is to declare the AsyncTask in a retained headless fragment. See Section 8, “Fragments and background processing” for more information.
