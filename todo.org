* Code Cleanup
** DONE Refactor PhoneBoot to use a service
 + Receivers cannot perform long running operations!
** DONE No receiver can call the database directly
** TODO use enums in TaskDatabaseFacade
** TODO save new repeating tasks in AlarmManager$GetNextAlarm with batch operation
** TODO make sure db is multi-thread safe
* UI
** TODO implement cartoon animation to swipe to delete
* Bugs
** TODO revert "repeat hourly" to correct behavior
** TODO alarm doesn't vibrate when phone set in vibrate mode
** TODO don't forget to remove alarms when completing them!
** TODO back to back alarms don't update the due alarm dialog
* DONE Fix AlarmReceiver
 + As per the docs, receivers are designed for short operations.
 + However, the AlarmReceiver calls ~findNextDueAlarm~, which is now a potentially
   heavy db operation
** DONE Create a service to call findNextDueAlarm
 + the catch is that the phone might go back to sleep before we do our work
   so we need to grab a wake lock
*** DONE Grab a wake lock in the service and make sure to let it go
*** DONE Create an Async task to findNextDueAlarm

* Testing
** TODO Get Guice working!
*** TODO Retest alarm manager using test-defined NOW, not the actual current time
*** TODO Test case when there are multiple alarms backed up
 + i.e, dueTime1 = 12pm, dueTime2 = 12:01pm, etc. and NOW = 12:05pm
