* Code Cleanup
** TODO Refactor PhoneBoot to use a service
 + Receivers cannot perform long running operations!
** TODO No receiver can call the database directly
* Backend
** TODO make sure db is multi-thread safe
* UI
** TODO implement cartoon animation to swipe to delete
* Bugs
** TODO alarm doesn't vibrate when phone set in vibrate mode
* TODO Fix AlarmReceiver
 + As per the docs, receivers are designed for short operations.
 + However, the AlarmReceiver calls ~findNextDueAlarm~, which is now a potentially
   heavy db operation
** TODO Create a service to call findNextDueAlarm
 + the catch is that the phone might go back to sleep before we do our work
   so we need to grab a wake lock
*** TODO Grab a wake lock in the service and make sure to let it go
*** TODO Create an Async task to findNextDueAlarm
