The only gotcha is deleting a repeating appointment. Does the user
delete all occurrences? all occurrences before given date?
or after a given date?

Deleting all occurrences is the simple case. Just mark that
object for deletion. 

Originally, startDate = date appointment was created and endDate = null. 
If deleting all occurrences after date, set endDate = new date.
If deleting all occureences before date, set startDate = new
date.
